2. Gather high-quality images for each section
3. Apply the enhanced structure to the island guide page
4. Customize content to highlight the unique features of each island

### Required Resources:
- High-quality images for each island (beaches, villages, landmarks, etc.)
- Detailed information about each island's history, culture, and attractions
- Specific details about beaches, activities, and dining options

### Implementation Priority:
1. Popular islands first (Naxos, Paros)
2. Medium-sized islands (Andros, Syros, Tinos)
3. Smaller islands (Antiparos, Kea, Kimolos, Koufonisia, Sifnos)

## Image Requirements
For each island, we need the following images:
- Aerial view
- Main town/village details
- Beaches (at least 5-6 different beaches)
- Landmarks and attractions
- Local cuisine and restaurants
- Cultural elements (churches, museums, etc.)

## Next Steps
