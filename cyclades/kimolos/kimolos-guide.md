---

## Where is Kimolos and How to Get There

### Location and Geography

Kimolos is located in the **Western Cyclades**, just **1 kilometer** from the northeastern tip of Milos. As a volcanic island in the Aegean Sea, Kimolos is part of the broader Cyclades archipelago and sits near other notable islands including Sifnos, Paros, and Santorini.

The island features a rugged terrain shaped by volcanic activity, with several open bays created by natural siltation and rain currents. The island's southern coastal side is particularly striking, with dramatic cliffs and unique geological formations that set it apart from other Mediterranean destinations.

Because there is **no airport** on the island, Kimolos is accessible only by sea—making it one of Greece's most naturally protected and underdeveloped islands.
