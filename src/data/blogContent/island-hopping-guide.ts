## Planning Your Route

### Golden Rules of Island Hopping

1. **Less is more**: 3-4 islands in 10 days beats 6 islands rushed
2. **Allow buffer days**: Ferries can be delayed (rare but happens)
3. **Book ferries 2+ weeks ahead**: Summer routes sell out
4. **End where you fly out**: Don't backtrack to Athens
5. **Mix vibes**: Balance busy islands with quiet ones

### Geographic Clusters

The Cyclades naturally group into clusters – hopping within clusters is easy:

**Northern Cluster:**
- Syros → Tinos → Mykonos → Andros

**Central Cluster:**
- Naxos ↔ Paros (frequent ferries, 45 min)
- Add: Antiparos, Koufonisia, Amorgos

**Southern Cluster:**
- Santorini → Ios → Folegandros → Sikinos

**Western Cluster:**
- Milos → Sifnos → Serifos → Kythnos

## FAQ

**How many islands can I visit in 10 days?**
Comfortably 3-4 islands. Rushing more diminishes the experience.

**Do I need to book ferries in advance?**
In summer (July-August), yes – 2+ weeks ahead. Shoulder season is more flexible.

**Can I take my luggage on ferries?**
Yes, but soft bags/backpacks are easier. No luggage limits on regular ferries.

**What if a ferry is cancelled?**
Companies rebook you on the next available. Buy flexible accommodation.

**Should I rent a car on every island?**
No. Most islands are small enough for scooters or buses. Car only needed on Naxos if exploring mountains.
