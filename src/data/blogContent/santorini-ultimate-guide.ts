## The Iconic Santorini Blue

![Close-up of traditional blue-domed church architecture](/images/islands/santorini/blue-domes.jpg)

The quintessential image of Santorini is undeniably its landscape of gleaming whitewashed buildings crowned with vibrant blue domes. This stunning and harmonious blue and white color scheme is not just aesthetically pleasing; it's a powerful symbol of Greek national pride. This iconic look was even reinforced by a law passed in 1974, ensuring the preservation of this unique visual identity that makes Santorini instantly recognizable and utterly captivating worldwide.

The specific blue used on the domes is called "Cycladic blue" or "Greek blue" and represents:
- **The Sea**: Reflecting the endless Aegean waters surrounding the islands
- **The Sky**: Symbolizing the vast Mediterranean sky
- **Freedom**: A tribute to Greek independence and national pride
- **Tranquility**: Evoking the peaceful, meditative quality of island life

This color combination, mandated by law, ensures that all new construction maintains the traditional aesthetic that has made Santorini one of the world's most photographed destinations.
