## Frequently Asked Questions {#frequently-asked-questions}

### Is 7 days enough for island hopping?
Yes, 7 days is perfect for visiting 2-3 islands. This itinerary covers three major islands with enough time to experience each without feeling rushed. For a more relaxed pace, consider 10-14 days.

### Do I need to rent a car on each island?
Not necessarily. Mykonos and Santorini have good public transportation and taxis. Naxos benefits from a car rental for one day to explore mountain villages, but it's not essential if you stay in Naxos Town.

### Can I do this itinerary in reverse?
Absolutely! Start with Santorini and end with Mykonos. Ferry connections work both ways. Consider your arrival/departure points when deciding direction.

### What if a ferry is canceled?
Ferry cancellations due to weather are possible, especially in windy months. Ferry companies typically offer refunds or rebooking. Always have travel insurance and flexible accommodation bookings. Consider booking refundable accommodations.

### Is this itinerary suitable for families?
Yes, with modifications. Naxos is very family-friendly. Mykonos and Santorini can work for families, but consider staying in family-friendly areas (Ornos in Mykonos, Perissa in Santorini) rather than party zones.

### How far in advance should I book?
- **Accommodation**: 3-6 months for peak season, especially Santorini
- **Ferries**: 2-3 weeks for peak season
- **Restaurants**: 1-2 weeks for popular spots in Mykonos/Santorini
- **Activities**: 1-2 weeks for tours and experiences
