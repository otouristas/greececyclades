## Greek Phrases Page Components

This directory contains the components for the Greek Phrases page:

1. **PhraseCard.tsx** - Component for displaying individual Greek phrases with audio playback
2. **GreekTranslator.tsx** - Component for translating text to Greek

### Image Requirements

For the Greek Phrases page to display correctly, you'll need to add the following image:

- `/images/greek-phrases-hero.jpg` - A hero image for the Greek Phrases page (suggested: a scenic view of Greece with Greek text or signage visible)

### Audio Requirements

The audio files for phrase pronunciation should be placed in:
- `/audio/phrases/` directory

Each audio file should be named according to the phrase it represents, for example:
- `/audio/phrases/hello.mp3`
- `/audio/phrases/thank-you.mp3`

Until actual audio recordings are available, the audio playback buttons will display but won't play actual audio.
